If you want to test the app yourself you must link it to your own firebase 

We first start off with a login screen where you just need an email address and password. To register you just add both credentials and press register.</br>

You are then put into the welcome screen. Here you create or join a game and you can also change your name or avatar icon. The question set is to choose which set of questions you want to use during the game.</br>

This is the question set page here you can choose the one you want to use and also rename the question set so you’ll know the general idea of what kind of questions are in there. The edit button will take you to another page where you can change each individual question. Rename will popup a dialog to change the name of the Question Set.</br>

After you click that edit button on the question set it will take you to this page here is where you type any question you want to use during the game. Question Set 1 will have default questions ready to use and is the default selected question set.</br>

This is the avatar icon page here you can select the one that you want to use during the game. It will show up when the game is live and on the welcome screen.</br>

If you are the host of the game and you need to create one this is the screen that you will be seeing. Here you set the number of players and the time you want them to have to answer the question. You will also see the question set you choose, you will also have to create a room code for the others to join you. Once you are done you create the game and just wait till everyone you want joins.</br>

This is where the game begins each player's name and icon will be shown. A question will pop up and they will have to click I have or I have not. The host of the game has the option to start and end the game at any time. </br>

After a couple of rounds have gone by a mini-game will pop up. Here players will have to be stable and walk in a straight line. This is to test how drunk the players are. If they tilt the phone too much the screen will turn red and the player will then be removed from the game.</br>
